 <abstract>We present an approach for detecting salient(important) dates in texts in order to auto-matically build event timelines from a searchquery (e.g.the name of an event or person,etc.). This work was carried out on a corpusof newswire texts in English provided by theAgence France Presse (AFP). In order to ex-tract salient dates that warrant inclusion in anevent timeline, we first recognize and normal-ize temporal expressions in texts and then usea machine-learning approach to extract salientdates that relate to a particular topic. We fo-cused only on extracting the dates and not theevents to which they are related.</abstract>
 <introduction>Our aim here was to build thematic timelines fora general domain topic defined by a user query.This task, which involves the extraction of importantevents, is related to the tasks ofRetrospective EventDetection(Yang et al., 1998), orNew Event Detec-tion, as defined for example in Topic Detection andTracking (TDT) campaigns (Allan, 2002).The majority of systems designed to tackle thistask make use of textual information in a bag-of-words manner. They use little temporal informa-tion, generally only using document metadata, suchas the document creation time (DCT). The few sys-tems that do make use of temporal information (suchas the now discontinued Google timeline), only ex-tract absolute, full dates (that feature a day, monthand year). In our corpus, described in Section 3.1,we found that only 7% of extracted temporal expres-sions are absolute dates. We distinguish our work from that of previous re-searchers in that we have focused primarily on ex-tracted temporal information as opposed to othertextual content. We show that using linguistic tem-poral processing helps extract important events intexts. Our system extracts a maximum of temporalinformation and uses only this information to detectsalient dates for the construction of event timelines.Other types of content are used for initial thematicdocument retrieval. Output is a list of dates, rankedfrom most important to least important with respectto the given topic. Each date is presented with a setof relevant sentences.We can see this work as a new, easily evaluabletask of “date extraction”, which is an important com-ponent of timeline summarization.In what follows, we first review some of the re-lated work in Section 2. Section 3 presents the re-sources used and gives an overview of the system.The system used for temporal analysis is describedin Section 4, and the strategy used for indexing andfinding salient dates, as well as the results obtained,are given in Section 5.</introduction>

 <conclusion>This article presents a task of “date extraction” andshows the importance of taking temporal informa-tion into consideration and how with relatively sim-ple temporal processing, we were able to indirectlypoint to important events using the temporal infor-mation associated with these events. Of course, asour final goal consists in the detection of importantevents, we need to take into account the textual con-tent. In future work, we envisage providing, togetherwith the detection of salient dates, a semantic analy-sis that will help determine the importance of events.Another interesting direction in which we soon aimto work is to consider all textual excerpts that are as-sociated with salient dates, and use clustering tech-niques to determine if textual excerpts correspond tothe same event or not. Finally, as our news corpusis available both for English and French (compara-ble corpus, not necessarily translations), we aim toinvestigate cross-lingual extraction of salient datesand salient events.</conclusion>
 <discussion> Chronologies hand-written by journalists are a veryuseful resources for evaluation of our system, as theyare completely dissociated from our research and arean exact representation of the output we aim to ob-tain. However, assembling such a chronology is avery subjective task, and no clear method for evalu-ation agreement between two journalists seems im-mediately apparent. Only experts can build suchchronologies, and calculating this agreement wouldrequire at least two experts from each domain, whichare hard to come by. One may then consider our sys-tem as a useful tool for building a chronology moreobjectively.To illustrate this point, we chose four specific top-ics6and showed one of our runs on each topic to anAFP expert for these subjects. We asked him to as-sess the first 30 dates of these runs.6Namely,“Arab revolt timeline for Morocco”,“Kyrgyzs-tan unrest timeline”,“Lebanon’s new government: a timeline”,“Libya timeline”.TopicAPCAPEMorocco0.58470.5718Kyrgyzstan0.61250.9989Libya0.78561Lebanon0.46730.7652Table 4: Average precision results for manual evaluationon 4 topics, against the original chronologies (APC), andthe expert assessment (APE).Table 4 presents results for this evaluation, com-paring average precision values obtained 1) againstthe original, manual chronologies (APC), and 2)against the expert assessment (APE). These valuesshow that, for 3 runs out of 4, many dates returnedby the system are considered as valid by the expert,even if not presented in the original chronology.Even if this experiment is not strong enough tolead to a formal conclusion (post-hocevaluationwith only 4 topics and a single assessor), this tendsto show that our system produces usable outputs andthat our system can be of help to journalists by pro-viding them with chronologies that are as useful andobjective as possible</discussion>
