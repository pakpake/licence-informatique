 <abstract>Much of the existing research on the social and ethical impact of Artificial Intelligence has beenfocused on defining ethical principles and guidelines surrounding Machine Learning (ML) and otherArtificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms [IEEE, 2017, Jobin et al., 2019]. While this is extremely useful forhelping define the appropriate social norms of AI, we believe that it is equally important to discuss boththe potential and risks of ML and to inspire the community to use ML for beneficial objectives. In thepresent article, which is specifically aimed at ML practitioners, we thus focus more on the latter, carryingout an overview of existing high-level ethical frameworks and guidelines, but above all proposing bothconceptual and practical principles and guidelines for ML research and deployment, insisting on concreteactions that can be taken by practitioners to pursue a more ethical and moral practice of ML aimed atusing AI for social good.</abstract>

 <conclusion>Technology in general, and ML more specifically, carries a great potential for change and disruption. Whileneither of these is guaranteed to make the world a better place, this potential can most definitely be usedto have a positive impact on the world. In the present article, we have illustrated some inspiring projectsthat aim to make the world a better place and by using the powerful techniques and approaches that ML hasbrought forward. We believe that as ML researchers and practitioners, we have the responsibility to leverageour (super)powers to contribute to these efforts. This can be done by connecting with established actors fromindustry and policy or experts from other relevant disciplines, by learning from their past experiences, andby working together to propose innovative solutions to major problems, deployed in places where they willhave a positive impact.We live in a world with many global and local challenges and issues that are in constant evolution, andit is easy to be overwhelmed by this flux of information and focus on a small sandbox in which we feelsafe and in control, in order to develop and study the aspects of ML that interest us most. But it is naive to believe that our sandbox is an isolated isle that is not connected to the rest of the world – since even inthe case of theoretical work, communication and cross-pollination are unavoidable – and each of us is alsoa citizen who is concerned collective debates, while many of us could worry about the world in which ourdescendants will live. We believe that there are thought processes that should take place in the head of everyML practitioner regarding the nature of the work they are doing and the potential pitfalls and impacts ofthis work in the world around them, some of which we have listed in the first part of the current paper. Andwhile we do not claim to have all the answers to all of these tough questions, we hope that we can start aconversation that will accompany ML research and practice throughout its infancy towards its tumultuousteenage years in the coming decades, and eventually towards mature adulthood beyond that.</conclusion>
