   <abstract>The evolution of the job market has resulted in traditional methods of recruitment becom-ing insufficient. As it is now necessary to handle volumes of information (mostly in theform of free text) that are impossible to process manually, an analysis and assisted catego-rization are essential to address this issue. In this paper, we present a combination of theE-Gen andCORTEXsystems. E-Gen aims to perform analysis and categorization of job offerstogether with the responses given by the candidates. E-Gen system strategy is based onvectorial and probabilistic models to solve the problem of profiling applications accordingto a specific job offer.CORTEXis a statistical automatic summarization system. In this work,E-Gen uses Cortex as a powerful filter to eliminate irrelevant information contained incandidate answers. Our main objective is to develop a system to assist a recruitmentconsultant and the results obtained by the proposed combination surpass those of E-Genin standalone mode on this task.</abstract>
   <introduction>The evolution of the job market has resulted in that traditional methods of recruitment becoming insufficient. TheInternet has introduced a new way of managing human resources. Theoretically, shifting job search and recruitment activ-ities to the Internet improves the quality of job matching by reducing search costs, increasing contact opportunities andrationalizing the screening process of job applicants (Marchal, Mellet, & Rieucau, 2007). Over the last few years, there hasbeen a significant expansion of online recruitment (e.g. August 2003: 177,000 job offers, May 2008: 500,000 job offers).1The Internet has become essential in this process because it allows a better flow of information, either through job searchsites or by e-mail exchanges. Nowadays, job seekers can send their curriculum vitae (CV) directly to companies (by e-mailor uploaded to dedicated servers on the Web). The job search task is becoming easier and less time consuming. The Internetmakes every user a potential job seeker. Employees may be constantly in search of new career opportunities and job candi-dates may provide more interaction than can be managed efficiently by companies (Bourse, LeclFre, Morin, & Trichet, 2004).As intellectual capital has become one of the most strategic assets of successful organizations in the last decade, the capa-bility of managing people’s expertise, skills and experience represents a key factor in facing up to the increasing competitive-ness of the global market (Colucci et al., 2003). Even though a browser has become a universal and easy tool for users, they frequently have to enter data into Web forms from paper sources and the need to ‘‘copy and paste’’ data between differentapplications is symptomatic of the issues of data integration. In this context, electronic recruitment tends to automate match-ing between the published information about the candidates and job offers. TheLaboratoire Informatique d’Avignon(LIA),2theLaboratoire d’Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier(LIRMM),3and Aktor Interactive4are developingthe E-Gen system to resolve this issue. E-Gen is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) systemcomposed of three main modules: 1. The first one extracts the information from a corpus of e-mails of job offers from Aktor’s database.2. The second module analyses the candidate’s answers (i.e. splitting e-mails into cover letter (CL) and curriculum vitae).3. The third module analyses and computes a relevant ranking of the candidate’s answers.Our first work (Kessler, Torres-Moreno, & El-Bèze, 2007) presented the first module: the identification of different partsof a job offer and the extraction of relevant information (type of contract, salary, localization, etc.). The second moduleanalyses the content of a candidate’s e-mail, using a combination of rules and machine learning methods (Support VectorMachines, SVM) and was presented inKessler, Torres-Moreno, and El-Bèze (2008b). Furthermore, it separates the distinctparts of CV and CL with a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.96. Reading a large number of candidate answers for a job is avery time consuming task for a recruiting consultant. In order to facilitate this task, we propose a system capable of pro-viding an initial evaluation of candidate answers according to various criteria. We do not seek the best or even a good can-didate as no scoring is involved, but simply a candidate who has a close application to those already selected. Our previouswork (Kessler, Béchet, Roche, El-Bèze, & Torres-Moreno, 2009) presented an approach based on a process of relevance feed-back, permitting a reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998). In this paper, we present an original combination of theE-Gen andCORTEXsystems. Each document contains a number of additional information, present in many applications andwhich is partially removed by classical pre-processing. Each application added by the process of relevance feedback addsrelevant information but also multiplies additional information.CORTEXallows us to filter these sentences and keep only themost relevant sentences at the evaluation step. Some related studies are briefly discussed in Section2. Section3shows ageneral system overview. In Section4, we describe the E-Gen pre-processing task, the strategy used to rank the candidateanswers with relevance feedback and the coupling of E-Gen with theCORTEXsummarization system. In Section5, we presentstatistics about the textual corpus, experimental protocol, an example of CL summary generated byCORTEX, and severalresults.</introduction>

   <conclusion>Job offer processing is a difficult and highly subjective task. The retrieval of relevant information concerning job descrip-tions and skills is not a trivial task (Loth et al., 2010) and results on this type of document have been quite low (Clech &Table 4Comparison of AUC score for each size of Relevance Feedback withCORTEXsummarization system.Size of Relevance FeedbackISMIS resultFull CV and CL summary 30% compression rateRandom distribution0.5000.500RF00.6420.653RF10.6540.658RF20.6570.659RF30.6590.661RF40.6590.659RF50.6600.662RF60.6610.663Fig. 5.Results of Relevance Feedback with and without summaries of CL.R. Kessler et al./Information Processing and Management 48 (2012) 1124–11351133 Zighed, 2003). The information we use in this kind of process is not well formated in natural language, but follows a conven-tional structure. This paper deals with theCORTEXsummarizer and the E-Gen system for processing job offers. E-Gen assists anemployer in the recruitment task. This paper focuses on candidate answers to job offers. We rank the candidate answers byusing different similarity measures and different document representations in a vector space model. We use a process of rel-evance feedback to perform reinforcement learning, whereby each new application added to the process assists in the deci-sion-making. We choose to evaluate the quality of our approaches by computingArea Under the Curve.CORTEXis asummarization system using an optimal decision algorithm that combines several metrics. We present the results obtainedby combining both systems. AUC obtained with summarized cover letter at 30% of compression size and a full CV shows aslight improvement in the results. As future work, we plan to apply other techniques, such as finding discriminant features ofirrelevant applications using the Rocchio algorithm (Rocchio, 1971), weighting the different parts of an application, etc. inorder to improve results. We also plan to use a categorization of jobs to take into consideration similar jobs, such as ’’devel-oper’’ and ‘‘programmer’’. Finally we propose to measure the CV quality by building an evaluation on an Internet portal. Ouraim with this evaluation is to present a job-seeker with a list of the most suitable job ads according to his profile.</conclusion>
