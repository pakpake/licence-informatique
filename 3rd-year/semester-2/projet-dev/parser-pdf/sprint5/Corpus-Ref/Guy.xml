   <abstract> Unsupervise learned word embeddings have seentremendous success in numerous Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks in recent years. The main contribution of thispaper is to develop a technique called Skill2vec, which appliesmachine learning techniques in recruitment to enhance thesearch strategy to find candidates possessing the appropriateskills. Skill2vec is a neural network architecture inspired byWord2vec, developed by Mikolov et al. in 2013. It transforms skills to new vector space, which has the characteristics ofcalculation and presents skills relationships. We conducted anexperiment evaluation manually by a recruitment company’sdomain experts to demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach.</abstract>
   <introduction> Recruiters in information technology domain have met theproblem finding appropriate candidates by their skills. In theresume, the candidate may describe one skill in differentways or skills could be replaced by others. The recruitersmay not have the domain knowledge to know if one’s skillsare fit or not, so they can only find ones with matched skills.In order to cope with the problem, one should try tofind the relatedness of skills. There are some approaches:building a dictionary manually, ontology approach, naturallanguage processing methods, etc. In this study, we apply aword embedding method Word2Vec, using skills from onlinejob post descriptions. We treat skills as terms, job posts asdocuments and find the relatedness of these skills.</introduction>

   <conclusion> In this paper, we developed a relationship network betweenskills in recruitment domain by using the neural net inspiredby Word2vec model. We observed that it is possible totrain high quality word vectors using very simple modelarchitectures due to lower cost of computation. Moreover,it is possible to compute very accurate high dimensionalword vectors from a much larger dataset. Using Skip-gramarchitecture and an advanced technique for preprocessingdata, the result seems to be impressive. The result of ourwork can contribute to building the matching system betweencandidates and job post. In the other hand, candidates canfind the gap between the job post requirements and theirability, so they can find the suitable trainings.A direction we can follow in the future: adding domainin training model, for example: BetweenPython,Java, andR, inData Sciencedomain,PythonandRare more relevantthanJava, however inBack Enddomain,PythonandJavaare more relevant than R.</conclusion>
