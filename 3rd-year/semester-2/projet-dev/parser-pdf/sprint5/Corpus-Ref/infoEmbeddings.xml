 <abstract>Due to an exponential rise in the social media user base, incidents like hate speech,trolling, cyberbullying are also increasing and that lead hate speech detection prob-lem reshaped into different tasks like Aggression detection, Fact detection. Thispaper attempt to study the effectiveness of text representation schemes on twotasks namely: User Aggression and Fact Detection from the social media contents.In User Aggression detection, The aim is to identify the level of aggression fromthe contents generated in the Social media and written in the English, DevanagariHindi and Romanized Hindi. Aggression levels are categorized into three predefinedclasses namely: ‘Non-aggressive‘, ‘Overtly Aggressive‘, and ‘Covertly Aggressive‘.During the disaster-related incident, Social media like, Twitter is flooded with mil-lions of posts. In such emergency situations, identification of factual posts is impor-tant for organizations involved in the relief operation. We anticipated this problemas a combination of classification and Ranking problem. This paper presents a com-parison of various text representation scheme based on BoW techniques, distributedword/sentence representation, transfer learning on classifiers. WeightedF1score isused as a primary evaluation metric. Results show that text representation usingBoW performs better than word embedding on machine learning classifiers. Whilepre-trained Word embedding techniques perform better on classifiers based on deepneural net. Recent transfer learning model like ELMO, ULMFiT are fine-tunedfor the Aggression classification task. However, results are not at par with pre-trained word embedding model. Overall, word embedding using fastText producebest weightedF1-score than Word2Vec and Glove. Results are further improvedusing pre-trained vector model. Statistical significance tests are employed to en-sure the significance of the classification results. In the case of lexically differenttest Dataset, other than training Dataset, deep neural models are more robust andperform substantially better than machine learning classifiers.</abstract>
 <introduction>The Social Web is a great source for studying human interaction and behavior. Inthe last few years, there is an exponential growth in Social Media user base. Sensingcontent of Social Media like Facebook, Twitter, by the smart autonomous applicationempower its user community with real-time information which is unfolded across thedifferent part of the world. Social media provide the easiest and anonymous platformfor common people to voice their opinion or view on a various entity like celebrity,politician, product, stock market etc or any social movement. Sometime such opinionsmight be aggressive in nature and propagate hate in the social media community.With the unprecedented increase in the user base of the social media and its avail-ability on the Smartphones, incidents like Hate speech, trolling, Cyberbullying, andAggressive posts are increasing exponentially. A smart autonomous system is requiredwhich enable surveillance on the social media platform and detect such incidents.Some of the researchers look posts from the aspect like aggression Kumar Ritesh etal. (2018) to filter the contents. some of the posts contain words which might be qual-ified as either highly or overly aggressive or have hidden aggression. Sometimes postsdo not have any aggression. Based on these, posts or comments are categorized intothree classes namely: ‘Overtly Aggressive‘, ‘Covertly Aggressive‘ and ‘Non-aggressive‘Kumar Ritesh et al. (2018). Henceforth, in the rest of the paper, we will denote theseclasses by these abbreviations namely: OAG, CAG, NAG respectively.Table 1 showsthe sample posts belonging to these classes.Social Media, specifically Microblog has proved its importance during the disaster-related incidents like an earthquake, Hurricane and floods1. Organizations involvedin relief operation actively track posts related to situational information posted onFacebook and Twitter during the disaster. However, At the same time, social mediais flooded with lots of prayer and condolence messages. Posts which contain factualinformation are extremely important for the organization involved in post-disasterrelief operations for coordination. Filtering and Ranking of the posts containing factualinformation will be very useful to them. We believe that this is the special problemof the Sentiment Analysis task. We consider this problem as a combination of two-class classification problem: factual posts and nob-factual posts plus Ranking. Table2 shows the example of the posts of belong to these class.The Text representation of social web content plays a pivotal role in any NLP task.Bag-of-word is the oldest and simple technique to represent the document or post intoa fixed length vector. The BoW techniques generate very sparse and high dimensionalspace vector. Text representation using distributed word/sentence representation orword embedding is gain rapid momentum recently. In this paper, one of the objectives is to find the best text representation scheme to model social web content for themachine learning classifier and deep neural net. Various Text representation schemebased on BoW, word embedding and are studied empirically. We have reported resulton popular word embedding technique like Word2vec, Glove and fastText on stan-dard machine learning classifier like Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Logistic Re-gression(LR), K-Nearest neighbors KNN, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), DecisionTree (DT),Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD), Random forest (RF), Ridge, AdaBoost,Perceptron, Deep neural net based on LSTM, CNN and Bidirectional LSTM. Resultsare also reported on Doc2vec embedding, a popular sentence or paragraph embeddingtechnique for the above classifiers.Transfer Learning is well practiced in the area of computer vision. However, in theNLP, transfer learning has limited application in the form of pre-trained word vectorwhich is used to initialize the weights of the embedding layer of the deep neural net-work. With the advent of transfer learning method like ELMO (Peters et al. , 2018),ULMFiT (Howaard et al., 2018) claimed substantial improvement in the performanceof various NLP tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Question/Answering, Textual Entail-ment empirically. The main idea behind these methods is to train language modelon the large corpus and fine tune on the task-specific corpus. In this paper, We haveevaluated the performance of these methods in the Aggression classification tasks.</introduction>

 <conclusion> In this Paper, Multilingual Social media stream is studied with special kind of textfeatures: Aggression and fact perspective. Exhaustive experiments are performed tobenchmark the text representation scheme on machine learning classifiers and deepneural nets. From the results, we conclude that deep Neural model with pre-trainedword embedding is the better choice than machine earning classifier and transfer learn-ing model. Word embedding is the better text representative scheme than Bag-of-wordsfor the deep neural models. In fact, performance can be improved with the help of fast-Text pre-trained vector. However, machine learning classifiers perform better in BoWwith TF/IDF weighting than word embedding. We also concluded that higher dropout will help to counter model overfitting and improvise a standard evaluation metrics.CNN and LSTM are the better models for these datasets. On the English test corpus,we obtained a better weightedF1score for NAG class and poor weightedF1scorefor CAG class which supports the previous (Malmasi, et al. , 2017) findings. For theFacebook Hindi test corpus, the same seems not to be true. We obtained a better F1score for CAG class than NAG class. It is also to be noted that the model leads topoor result on Twitter test data since the training corpus was created from Facebook.In such cases, deep neural models substantially outperform machine learning classi-fiers. Significance test confirms these claims with 95 % confidence interval in most thecases. Our work shows what kind of problems are moving into the center of attentionfor research in machine learning. Using deep learning models, there is great potentialto solve some of these problems, yet still, the performance is far from perfect. Modeltransfer between problems and the application of derived knowledge in user interfacesare areas directions for future work.</conclusion>
