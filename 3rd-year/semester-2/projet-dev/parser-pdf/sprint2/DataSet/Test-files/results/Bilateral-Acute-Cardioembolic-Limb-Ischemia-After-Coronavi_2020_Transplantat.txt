Bilateral Acute Cardioembolic Limb Ischemia After Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in a Lung Transplant Recipient: A Case Report
Benjamin Renaud-Picard
ABSTRACT Very few cases of lung transplant patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Very few cases of lung transplant patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported to date. A 31-year-old patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation for cystic ﬁbrosis in 2012 was admitted for severe acute lower limb pain. He had a conﬁrmed exposure to COVID-19 and a 3-week history of upper respiratory tract infection. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed an occlusion of the 2 common femoral arteries. CT angiography detected an intracardiac thrombus in the left ventricle. Chest CT angiography showed ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. A bilateral femoral surgical embolectomy using Fogarty catheter was successfully performed. Speciﬁc reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 performed on an extracted thrombus was negative, but IgM antibodies speciﬁc for COVID-19 were detected. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a subendocardial and almost transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the mid and distal inferolateral and inferior wall segments, consistent with a nonrecent myocardial infarction and an apical centimetric thrombus adjacent to the lesion. Thrombophilia laboratory tests found the presence of a positive lupus anticoagulant. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin was prescribed. On day 13, the patient was discharged from the hospital. This case underlines the need to be vigilant with respect to the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 and raises the issue of thrombosis prevention in COVID-19 patients.
