ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES This study sought to characterize in-hospital treatment patterns and associated patient outcomes among OBJECTIVES This study sought to characterize in-hospital treatment patterns and associated patient outcomes among patients hospitalized for heart failure (HF) in U.S. clinical practice. BACKGROUND Hospitalizations for HF are common and associated with poor patient outcomes. Real-world patterns of in-hospital treatment, including diuretic therapy, in contemporary U.S. practice are unknown. METHODS Using Optum de-identiﬁed Electronic Health Record data from 2007 through 2018, patients hospitalized for a primary diagnosis of HF (ejection fraction #40%) and who were hemodynamically stable at admission, without concurrent acute coronary syndrome or end-stage renal disease, and treated with intravenous (IV) diuretic agents within 48 h of admission were identiﬁed. Patients were categorized into 1 of 4 mutually exclusive hierarchical treatment groups deﬁned by complexity of treatment during hospitalization (intensiﬁed treatment with mechanical support or IV vasoactive therapy, IV diuretic therapy reinitiated after discontinuation for $1 day without intensiﬁed treatment, IV diuretic dose increase/combination diuretic treatment without intensiﬁed treatment or IV diuretic reinitiation, or uncomplicated). RESULTS Of 22,677 patients hospitalized for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), 66% had uncomplicated hospitalizations without escalation of treatment beyond initial IV diuretic therapy. Among 7,809 remaining patients, the highest level of therapy received was IV diuretic dose increase/combination diuretic treatment in 25%, IV diuretic reinitiation in 36%, and intensiﬁed therapy in 39%. Overall, 19% of all patients had reinitiation of IV diuretic agents (26% of such patients had multiple instances), 12% were simultaneously treated with multiple diuretics, and 61% were transitioned to oral diuretic agents before discharge. Compared with uncomplicated treatment, IV diuretic reinitiation and intensiﬁed treatment were associated with signiﬁcantly longer median length of stay (uncomplicated: 4 days; IV diuretic reinitiation: 8 days; intensiﬁed: 10 days) and higher rates of in-hospital (uncomplicated: 1.6%; IV diuretic reinitiation: 4.2%; intensiﬁed: 13.2%) and 30-day post-discharge mortality (uncomplicated: 5.2%; IV diuretic reinitiation: 9.7%; intensiﬁed: 12.7%). CONCLUSIONS In this contemporary real-world population of U.S. patients hospitalized for HFrEF, one-third of patients had in-hospital treatment escalated beyond initial IV diuretic therapy. These more complex treatment patterns were associated with highly variable patterns of diuretic use, longer hospital lengths of stay, and higher mortality. Standardized and evidence-based approaches are needed to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of in-hospital HFrEF care.
