ear region of the stress-strain curve and undergoes permanent deformation. This study demonstrates that the same is ear region of the stress-strain curve and undergoes permanent deformation. This study demonstrates that the same is true for energy-storing tendons, and hence the fundamental mechanism of failure is preserved between both types of tendons. This has implications in common tendon injuries such as tendinopathy and acute rupture.
