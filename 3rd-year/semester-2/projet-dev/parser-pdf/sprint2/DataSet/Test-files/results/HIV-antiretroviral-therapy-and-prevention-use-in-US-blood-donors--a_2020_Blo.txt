HIV antiretroviral therapy and prevention use in US blood donors: a new blood safety concern
Brian Custer
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection are effective tools to help end the HIV epidemic. However, their use could affect l Fifteen percent of HIVHIV transfusion-transmission risk. Three different ART/PrEP prevalence analyses in blood positive donors in the donors were conducted. First, blood samples from HIV-positive and a comparison group of United States took ART within a few days infection-nonreactive donors were tested under blind using liquid chromatographybefore donating. tandem mass spectrometry for ART. Second, blood donor samples from infectionnonreactive, 18- to 45-year-old, male, ﬁrst-time blood donors in 6 US locations were l PrEP use proximate to donation was found in tested for emtricitabine and tenofovir. Third, in men who have sex with men (MSM) 0.6% of ﬁrst-time male participating in the 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National HIV Beblood donors and by havioral Surveillance (NHBS) from 5 US cities, self-reported PrEP use proximate to donation survey in 5% of MSM. was assessed. In blind testing, no ART was detected in 300 infection-nonreactive donor samples, but in 299 HIV conﬁrmed-infected donor samples, 46 (15.4%; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 11.5% to 20.0%) had evidence of ART. Of the 1494 samples tested from ﬁrst-time male donors, 9 (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.03% to 1.1%) had tenofovir and emtricitabine. In the NHBS MSM survey, 27 of 591 respondents (4.8%; 95% CI, 3.2% to 6.9%) reported donating blood in 2016 or 2017 and PrEP use within the same time frame as blood donation. Persons who are HIV positive and taking ART and persons taking PrEP to prevent HIV infection are donating blood. Both situations could lead to increased risk of HIV transfusion transmission if blood screening assays are unable to detect HIV in donations from infected donors.
