RICH with well-being: An entrepreneurial mindset for thriving in early-stage entrepreneurship
Stephen E. Lanivich
Entrepreneurs enjoy high well-being, yet they report factors that typically reduce well-being. We examined wellbeing of early-stage entrepreneurs across two studies. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we theorize that Entrepreneurs enjoy high well-being, yet they report factors that typically reduce well-being. We examined wellbeing of early-stage entrepreneurs across two studies. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we theorize that entrepreneursâ€™ autonomy, job security, and resource-induced coping heuristic (RICH) have direct and interacting effects that shape their environment toward enhancing well-being. Results largely support our hypotheses. Interaction effects highlight that entrepreneurial well-being environments are conditional on the interplay of SDT-related factors. Three-way interactions showed the RICH buffered negative effects of low autonomy and job security on job satisfaction and financial well-being.
