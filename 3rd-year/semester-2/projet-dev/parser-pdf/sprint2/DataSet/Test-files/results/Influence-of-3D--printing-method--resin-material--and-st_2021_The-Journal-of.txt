ABSTRACT placement may lead to the placement may lead to the Statement of problem. Three-dimensional printing has introduced new manufacturing methods. breakdown of osseointegraHowever, information on the inﬂuence of the speciﬁc printing technology, material, sterilization, tion, peri-implantitis, or unand the comparison between printing and milling on the accuracy of surgical guides is lacking. satisfactory esthetic outcomes, Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the inﬂuence of the manufacturing method resulting in unfavorable long(printing and milling), printing technology stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP), 1,2 term outcomes. During material, and sterilization on the accuracy of digitally designed surgical implant guides. implant planning, special Material and methods. Resin patient replicas with a single edentulous space were used to place attention has to be paid to 132 implants with digitally designed surgical guides. The accuracy of postoperative implant position critical anatomic structures, was analyzed for the manufacturing method (printing and milling), resin materials, and including the mandibular capreoperative autoclaving. To determine 3D accuracy, angular displacement, mean horizontal nal, maxillary sinus, and adjacrestal, apical displacement, and the linear vertical displacement at the apex were calculated cent teeth. Preoperative separately for each group (n=12). In addition, the surgical guides were qualitatively analyzed by using ﬁeld emission scanning electron micrograph. surgical implant planning is increasingly based on 3D Results. The postoperative angular deviation ranged from 0.76 ±0.52 degrees (Rapidshape D20II radiographic methods, particuwith NextDent SG) to 2.43 ±0.64 degrees (Form2 with NextDent SG) (P<.001). Linear horizontal larly cone beam computed todisplacement at the crest was smallest for Rapidshape D20II with 3Delta Guide (0.27 ±0.08 mm) and highest for Form2 with NextDent SG (0.54 ±0.10 mm) (P<.001). Linear horizontal mography (CBCT) scanning.3 displacement at the apex ranged from 0.36 ±0.10 mm (SolFlex 350 with V-Print SG) to 0.89 The optimal implant position ±0.32 mm (Form2 with NextDent SG) (P<.001). Considering the vertical position displacement can be virtually designed by was no more than 0.43 ±0.07 mm (Form2 with NextDent SG) short of the apex, none of the digitally matching the CBCT implant tips were displaced apically. Preoperative autoclaving differentially impaired the accuracy data and the data from a scan of surgical guides. of the diagnostic cast and then Conclusions. The speciﬁc manufacturing technique, the 3D printing device, the resin material, and transferring it into the clinical the application of preoperative sterilization all affected the accuracy of the postoperative implant situation with a surgical position. Irrespective of the manufacturing method, all implants were placed within the guide.4,5 Recently, surgical commonly accepted safety distance. (J Prosthet Dent 2020;-:---) implant guides have been 3Dprinted to overcome the disadvantages of subtractive and the related digital light processing (DLP) technique. milling.6-8 The most commonly used and cost-effective SLA uses an ultraviolet (UV) laser or laser diode to draw a method in dentistry has been stereolithography (SLA) cross-section layer by layer to build the printed object.
