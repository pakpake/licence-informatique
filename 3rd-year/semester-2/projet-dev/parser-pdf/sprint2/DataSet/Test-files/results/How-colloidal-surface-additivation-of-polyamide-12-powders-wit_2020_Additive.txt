As Additive Manufacturing (AM) is fast-growing, properties adaption of feedstock materials for AM is becoming As Additive Manufacturing (AM) is fast-growing, properties adaption of feedstock materials for AM is becoming more and more relevant due to high quality standards in industrial applications. Compared to traditional manufacturing techniques like injection molding, laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) of polymers has a very limited variety of processable materials, which is a major obstacle for future growth. Nanocomposites are an established material class for addressing the limitations in PBF-LB but often show poor dispersion of the nanomaterial in/on the polymer powder. Especially in the context of plasmonic nanomaterials and composites, where the state of aggregation considerably inﬂuences the optical properties, dispersion plays an important role. Our study presents a deeper understanding of the colloidal surface additivation of polyamide 12 (PA12) powders with laser-generated plasmonic silver nanoparticles, leading to high dispersion of the nanoparticles on the micropowder surface with good reproducibility. The additivation is ruled by colloidal stability and control of electrostatic forces between particles and resulted in powders that could successfully be processed on a PBF-LB machine to generate plasmonic-functionalized parts. Finally, we introduce the surface speciﬁc nanoparticle dose (surf%) as scaling key parameter complementary to the commonly used mass speciﬁc dose (wt%) to appropriately describe nanoparticle load, proving the eﬀect of such surface additivation on the recrystallization behavior of PA12. Via ﬂash calorimetry, already at 0.01 vol% silver load, signiﬁcant nanoparticle-induced heterogeneous nucleation eﬀects are evident, whereas the thermal properties analyzed by conventional calorimetry remain unaﬀected.
