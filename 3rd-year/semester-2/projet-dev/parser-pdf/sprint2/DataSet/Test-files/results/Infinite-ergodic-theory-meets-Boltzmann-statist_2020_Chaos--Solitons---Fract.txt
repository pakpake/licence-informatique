Infinite ergodic theory meets Boltzmann statistics
Erez Aghion
a b s t r a c t a b s t r a c t We investigate the overdamped stochastic dynamics of a particle in an asymptotically ﬂat external potential ﬁeld, in contact with a thermal bath. For an inﬁnite system size, the particles may escape the force ﬁeld and diffuse freely at large length scales. The partition function diverges and hence the standard canonical ensemble fails. This is replaced with tools stemming from inﬁnite ergodic theory. BoltzmannGibbs statistics, even though not normalized, still describes integrable observables, like energy and occupation times. The Boltzmann inﬁnite density is derived heuristically using an entropy maximization principle, as well as via a ﬁrst-principles calculation using an eigenfunction expansion in the continuum of low-energy states. A generalized virial theorem is derived, showing how the virial coeﬃcient describes the delay in the diffusive spreading of the particles, found at large distances. When the process is non-recurrent, e.g. diffusion in three dimensions with a Coulomb-like potential, we use weighted time averages to restore basic canonical relations between time and ensemble averages. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
