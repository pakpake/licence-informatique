The separation of ﬁne particles with ﬁlter cloth is a commonly used technique to remove particles from process The separation of ﬁne particles with ﬁlter cloth is a commonly used technique to remove particles from process streams under low-cost and low-maintenance conditions. Such kind of ﬁlter apparatus can be found, i.e., in front of distillation columns with the adjusted size. Here, it is possible to have a ﬁlter apparatus with ﬁlter elements ≤ 2.5 m in length and ≤ 100 elements in one vessel. For a constant and stable process conditions, a periodical regeneration of the ﬁlter cloth is absolute required. One option for realizing this procedure is discharging the built-up ﬁlter cake in liquid phase (backwashing ﬁltration). Due to the reverse ﬂow, a deformation of the ﬁlter cloth occurs. This deformation depends on the assembly situation, mechanical pre-loading of the weave, the environment of the system, the weave type and, of course, the backwashing pressure. The interaction of this variables results in an adjusting of the space between the ﬁlter elements and correspond with the required backwashing volume in l/m2. Inﬂuence of a contact between two ﬁlter elements is not known but can have a negative impact in case of remaining ﬁlter cake on surface. Too much space reduces the economy of the apparatus because less ﬁlter surface needs the same apparatus footprint. Thus, by knowing how the ﬁlter cloth expand, the space can be adjusted on the particular separation task. This can lead to an improvement of the ﬁlter surface per apparatus footprint and can be advantageously compared to competing separations procedures. The deformation of the ﬁlter cloth during the backwashing treatment is described and discussed in the context of this investigation on the basis of elementary mechanics.
