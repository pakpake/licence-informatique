An ALS-linked mutation in TDP-43 disrupts normal protein interactions in the motor neuron response to oxidative stress

TDP-43 pathology is a key feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanisms linking TDP-43 to TDP-43 pathology is a key feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanisms linking TDP-43 to altered cellular function and neurodegeneration remain unclear. We have recently described a mouse model in which human wild-type or mutant TDP-43 are expressed at low levels and where altered stress granule formation is a robust phenotype of TDP-43M337V/− expressing cells. In the present study we use this model to investigate the functional connectivity of human TDP-43 in primary motor neurons under resting conditions and in response to oxidative stress. The interactome of human TDP-43WT or TDP-43M337V was compared by mass spectrometry, and gene ontology enrichment analysis identiﬁed pathways dysregulated by the M337V mutation. We found that under normal conditions the interactome of human TDP-43WT was enriched for proteins involved in transcription, translation and poly(A)-RNA binding. In response to oxidative stress, TDP-43WT recruits proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomal-extracellular transport pathways, interactions which are reduced in the presence of the M337V mutation. Speciﬁcally, TDP-43M337V impaired protein-protein interactions involved in stress granule formation including reduced binding to the translation initiation factors Poly(A)-binding protein and Eif4a1 and the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone Grp78. The M337V mutation also aﬀected interactions involved in endosomal-extracellular transport and this this was associated with reduced extracellular vesicle secretion in primary motor neurons from TDP-43M337V/− mice and in human iPSCs-derived motor neurons. Taken together, our analysis highlights a TDP-43 interaction network in motor neurons and demonstrates that an ALS associated mutation may alter the interactome to drive aberrant pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.
