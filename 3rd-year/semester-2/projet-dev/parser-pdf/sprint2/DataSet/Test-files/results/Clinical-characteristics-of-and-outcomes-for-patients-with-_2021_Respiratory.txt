Clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 and comorbid lung diseases primarily hospitalized in a conventional pulmonology unit: A retrospective study

a b s t r a c t a b s t r a c t Background. – Scant data are currently available about a potential link between comorbid chronic lung diseases (CLD) and the risk and severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Methods. – To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological ﬁndings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. Results. – Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n = 50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 15, 12%) and asthma (n = 19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a signiﬁcantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.05) in these patients. Conclusions. – Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD. Further studies are warranted to determine the risk of COVID-19 for patients with comorbid CLD.
