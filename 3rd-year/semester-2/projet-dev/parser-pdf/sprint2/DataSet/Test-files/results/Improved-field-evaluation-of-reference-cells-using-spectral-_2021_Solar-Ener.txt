Improved field evaluation of reference cells using spectral measurements

Output from an IMT reference solar cell mounted on a one-axis tracking surface is investigated using spectral Output from an IMT reference solar cell mounted on a one-axis tracking surface is investigated using spectral measurements covering the 350–1650 nm range for selected days throughout the year. Comparisons are made to a Class-A pyranometer also mounted on the one-axis tracking surface. Systematic biases over the day and year are observed in the ratio of the reference cell’s measurements to reference pyranometer measurements. This sys­ tematic bias is associated with the spectral, temperature, and angle-of-incident effects that differ between the reference cell and the reference pyranometer. The comparison is done for selected clear and totally cloudy days to determine the magnitude of the effects and to characterize the influence of these effects on the reference cell measurements. A model to calculate the reference cell output based on spectral irradiance and reference cell temperature is introduced.
