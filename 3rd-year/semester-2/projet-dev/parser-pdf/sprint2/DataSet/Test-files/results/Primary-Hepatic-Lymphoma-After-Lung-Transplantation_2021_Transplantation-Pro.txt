Primary Hepatic Lymphoma After Lung Transplantation: A Report of 2 Cases
Edoardo Maria Muttillo
ABSTRACT Background. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of Background. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of noneHodgkin lymphoma in the posttransplant setting. Treatment is based on chemotherapy; surgery is still debated and should be performed in very select cases. Methods. We observed 2 patients out of 300 who underwent lung transplantation in the Nouvel Hopital Civil between 2013 and 2019 with primary hepatic lymphoma. Chemotherapy with a rituximab-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone protocol was performed in all patients. Mycophenolate mofetil was interrupted before treatment, and everolimus was introduced after chemotherapy by associating tacrolimus withdrawal. Results. One patient showed complete remission; after 7 years, no recurrence has been noticed. The second is still undergoing chemotherapy with no signs of disease progression. Conclusions. DLBCL risk is higher in solid organ transplant recipients than in the general population. Primary hepatic lymphoma diagnosis is often difﬁcult and based on histologic ﬁndings after initial clinical and radiological suspicion of primary or secondary liver neoplasia. Diagnosis is challenging because no clinical, radiological, or biological features exist. Biopsy is always indicated for histologic conﬁrmation. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy, but surgery may be indicated in very select patients.
