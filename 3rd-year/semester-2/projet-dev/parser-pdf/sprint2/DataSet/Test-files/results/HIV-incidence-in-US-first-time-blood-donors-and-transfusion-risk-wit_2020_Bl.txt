HIV incidence in US first-time blood donors and transfusion risk with a 12-month deferral for men who have sex with men

In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration published revised guidance that recommended In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration published revised guidance that recommended a change in blood donor deferral of men who have sex with men (MSM) from an indeﬁnite to a l HIV incidence in ﬁrst12-month deferral since the donor last had sex with a man. We assessed whether HIV incidence time donors was in ﬁrst-time blood donors or associated transfusion risk increased. Donations in 4 major blood similar before and after implementation collection organizations were monitored for 15 months before and 2 years after impleof the 12-month MSM mentation of the 12-month MSM deferral policy. HIV-positive donations were classiﬁed as deferral, both overall recently acquired or long-term using a recent infection testing algorithm and incidence in both and in males. periods estimated. Residual transfusion transmission risk was estimated by multiplying inl The residual risk of cidence by the length of the infectious window period. The latter was estimated using a model HIV transfusion based on infectious dose and the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing. Factors associated with transmission for components sourced incident infection in each period were assessed using Poisson regression. Overall HIV incidence from ﬁrst-time donors in ﬁrst-time donors before implementation of the 12-month MSM deferral was estimated at was low and did not 2.62 cases per 100 000 person-years (105 PY) (95% credible interval [CI], 1.53-3.93 cases/105 change signiﬁcantly. PY), and after implementation at 2.85 cases/105 PY (95% CI, 1.96-3.93 cases/105 PY), with no statistically signiﬁcant change. In male ﬁrst-time donors, the incidence difference was 0.93 5 cases/10 PY (95% CI, 21.74-3.58 cases/105 PY). The residual risk of HIV transfusion transmission through components sourced from ﬁrst-time donors was estimated at 0.32 transmissions per million (106) packed red blood cell transfusions (95% CI, 0.29-0.65 transmissions/106 transfusions) before and 0.35 transmissions/106 transfusions (95% CI, 0.31-0.65 transmissions/106 transfusions) after implementation. The difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Factors associated with incident infection were the same in each period. We observed no increase in HIV incidence or HIV transfusion transmission risk after implementation of a 12-month MSM deferral policy. (Blood. 2020;136(11):1359-1367) KEY POINTS
