Julius Krause
For the therapy of esophageal diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis, there are no possibilities of local targeted For the therapy of esophageal diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis, there are no possibilities of local targeted therapy. This publication describes a novel, innovative drug delivery concept, that enables a targeted, longlasting administration of drug substances to the esophageal mucosa. In addition to a comprehensive in-vitro characterization of the dosage form, this work includes a proof-of-concept study with healthy volunteers, which shows the functionality and acceptance of this novel drug delivery concept. This novel drug delivery technology enables for the ﬁrst time a targeted, local and long-lasting therapy of the esophagus.
