ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to identify well-tolerated doses of cimlanod in patients with acute heart failure OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to identify well-tolerated doses of cimlanod in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Secondary objectives were to identify signals of efﬁcacy, including biomarkers, symptoms, and clinical events. BACKGROUND Nitroxyl (HNO) donors have vasodilator, inotropic and lusitropic effects. Bristol-Myers Squibb-986231 (cimlanod) is an HNO donor being developed for acute heart failure (AHF). METHODS This was a phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 48-h treatment with cimlanod compared with placebo in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction #40% hospitalized for AHF. In part I, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to escalating doses of cimlanod or matching placebo. In part II, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either of the 2 highest tolerated doses of cimlanod from part I or placebo. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinically relevant hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or patients became symptomatic). RESULTS In part I (n ¼ 100), clinically relevant hypotension was more common with cimlanod than placebo (20% vs. 8%; relative risk [RR]: 2.45; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 14.53). In part II (n ¼ 222), the incidence of clinically relevant hypotension was 18% for placebo, 21% for cimlanod 6 mg/kg/min (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.58 to 2.43), and 35% for cimlanod 12 mg/kg/min (RR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.59). N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide and bilirubin decreased during infusion of cimlanod treatment compared with placebo, but these differences did not persist after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS Cimlanod at a dose of 6 mg/kg/min was reasonably well-tolerated compared with placebo. Cimlanod reduced markers of congestion, but this did not persist beyond the treatment period.
