The anticancer prodrug butyroyloxymethyl diethylphosphate (AN-7), upon metabolic hydrolysis, releases the The anticancer prodrug butyroyloxymethyl diethylphosphate (AN-7), upon metabolic hydrolysis, releases the histone deacetylase inhibitor butyric acid and imparts histone hyperacetylation. We have shown previously that AN-7 increases doxorubicin-induced cancer cell death and reduces doxorubicin toxicity and hypoxic damage to the heart and cardiomyocytes. The cardioﬁbroblasts remain unprotected against both insults. Herein we examined the selective eﬀect of AN-7 on hypoxic cardiomyocytes and cardioﬁbroblasts and investigated mechanisms underlying the cell speciﬁc response. Hypoxic cardiomyocytes and cardioﬁbroblasts or H2O2-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, were treated with AN-7 and cell damage and death were evaluated as well as cell signaling pathways and the expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). AN-7 diminished hypoxia-induced mitochondrial damage and cell death in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and reduced hydrogen peroxide damage in H9c2 cells while increasing cell injury and death in hypoxic cardioﬁbroblasts. In the cell line, AN-7 induced Akt and ERK survival pathway activation in a kinase-speciﬁc manner including phosphorylation of the respective downstream targets, GSK-3β and BAD. Hypoxic cardiomyocytes responded to AN-7 treatment by enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, GSK-3β and BAD and a signiﬁcant 6-fold elevation in HO-1 levels. In hypoxic cardioﬁbroblasts, AN-7 did not activate Akt and ERK beyond the eﬀect of hypoxia alone and induced a limited (~1.5-fold) increase in HO-1. The cell speciﬁc diﬀerences in kinase activation and in heme oxygenase-1 upregulation may explain, at least in part, the disparate outcome of AN-7 treatment in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and hypoxic cardioﬁbroblasts.
