were abstracted for a 20% random sample of 292 patients. Results Three-fourths of patients (74.3%) presenting for concussion care had a standardized visiovestibular Results Three-fourths of patients (74.3%) presenting for concussion care had a standardized visiovestibular assessment performed. Almost all of those who eventually sought specialty care (92.9%) also had such an assessment, and only 42.9% patients initially seen in the emergency department or urgent care were examined in this manner. Of those assessed, 62.7% (n = 136) demonstrated deficits, with children ages 9-11 years more frequently exhibiting deficits than their younger counterparts (67.9% vs 53.2%; P = .03). Almost all patients (95.9%) reported at least 1 somatic symptom (eg, headache, dizziness), and one-half to two-thirds reported problems with sleep (54.1%) and visiovestibular symptoms (66.1%). Only 11.6% of children were referred for rehabilitation therapies and less than one-half of concussed patients (43.8%) were provided with a letter recommending school accommodations. Conclusions Somatic symptoms, sleep problems, and visiovestibular deficits are common in elementary schoolaged children with concussion, but specific visiovestibular clinical assessments are often not performed, particularly in the emergency department setting. Recommendations for school accommodations are often not provided at the time of concussion diagnosis. Incorporating a standardized visiovestibular assessment into practice could facilitate early targeted school accommodations and thereby improve return to learning for elementary school-aged children with concussion.
