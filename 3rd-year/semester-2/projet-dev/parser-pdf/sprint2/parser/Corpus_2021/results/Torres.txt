We study a new content-based method for the evaluation of text summarization systems without the evaluation of text summarization systems without human models which is used to produce system rankings. The research is carried out using a new content-based evaluation framework called F RESA to compute a variety of divergences among probability distributions. We apply our comparison framework to various well-established content-based evaluation measures in text summarization such as C OVERAGE, R ESPONSIVENESS, P YRAMIDS and ROUGE studying their associations in various text summarization tasks including generic multi-document summarization in English and French, focus-based multi-document summarization in English and generic single-document summarization in French and Spanish. Index Terms—Text summarization evaluation, content-based evaluation measures, divergences.
